10/3/24 THU 
-Alr got 5, eh, 4 days to cook. Plan time. Ok. Cue cooking music.
-Steps, what needs to happen in rough order.
 -Make the elevator wall and window, the window split into 45 parts, though 47 keys will be used.
 -map each key to its section of the window and the surrounding sections.
 -create a way to destory window pices, then click a button to repair the repsective piece.
 -upward paralax scrolling background whcih scrolls through space. different colored space though which should 
  be easy as use the shift b and r in aepsrite.
 -screenshake and indicator when glass breaks.
 -animations for when little aliens and meteors and birds and stuff hit the glass.
 -link animations to glass break 
 -oxygen bar which increases if glass full, then decreases by X for every X glas pieces broken. 
 -little death animation when game over when dead.
 -menu screen and general GUI.
PLAN:
THU
 -Get keys to link to their pieces of glass, get sketch of elevator window and frame.
FRI 
 -method of "destorying glass"
 -scrolling background
SAT 
 -oxygen bar
 -things that break the glass
SUN 
 -menu 
MON 
-overflow and "polish"

-Ok taking A BIT longer than expected for the window but tbh thats to be expected. So yeah I got the process 
 down and have a good ideas in mind of how the keys will bind to it. Uploading the tiles will be more tedious 
 than difficult or challenging. Will just shut off brain and do a bit of grinding later.
-Ooh organize into a matrix: 
 -top row has 12C
 -second had 12C
 -third has 10C
 -fourth has 10C
-Can iterate through but skip if row >2 and if index >10. ok brb.
-We back.

IDEAS:
-make it so pressing a key doesnt auto repair all thats next
-screenshake... gtg rn

-Going to bed soon, need to make shakes more unpredicable and some of them more spiky so it not consistent ones 
 rather one big one. night.

10/3/24 FRI 
-Pivot! Ok you clean off the goo iunstead of repair the glass because then space looks cooler.
-Bar is now a "Wonder Bar" and you die if you get bored!
-NOPE instantiator which floats random space debris and planets upward and downward for that matter, will just 
 take random one from array of options and place it right outside of window view.
-put rat sitting on the windowsill of the elevator?
-ooh DONE make the eleator windowsill have an actual ledge opposed to just being a border, make it pop more...
-need to convert coords to pane num.
-DONE add splat animation, different aliens and make them different/random sizes. cool.
-oxygenbar tmr.

-Ok tmr, going to get the oxygenbar visuals working and the system moderately balanced, the goo animation
 instantiator, also pimp up the elevator wall visuals. Oh and get the shaking to work in sync with the 

10/4/24 SAT 
-Dude this game slaps. its lowkey fun. Need to do some balancing though lol.
-main TODOS are creating a menu, making a restart button and making a scoreboard. im thinking press space to 
 start from white screen, then 
-alr the space to start is a bit buggy still, need to work on that. need to add high score where it takes the 
 amount of open tiles, multiplies by the level, multipliues by 10, every second.
-ok think im done for the day with this, lots of good work though.

-TODO make a newhighscore screen when well, yeah.
-TODO make the elevator cutscene.
-TODO add sounds.
