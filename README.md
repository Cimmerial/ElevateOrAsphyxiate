# ElevateOrAsphyxiate

Coded between October 3rd 2024 and October 7th 2024 for the annual **Interstellar Game Jam**.

**ElevateOrAsphyxiate** is an arcade-style game made with Unity, which takes button mashing quite literally. Clean up the acid being shot at your elevator as you hurl through space! But beware! If the acid depletes your oxygen bar to zero, then it is GAME OVER, better luck next time. With a variety of enemies to face, a colorful spriteset and goofy animations, you can be sure to have fun with this fast paced arcade game!

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- **Enemy AI** Different types of enemies circulate around the screen, randomly dodging to keep the player on their toes, moving in erratic patterns to keep the player on their toes!
- **Mapping Keyboard Keys to their Relative Screen Position** The only way to win is to use nearly every key on your keyboard to clean up the acid! Each key was mapped to a position on the screen so that the player has to use a variety of key combinations in order to clean up any mess the aliens decide to throw their way!
- **Scorekeeping** Highscores are tracked between every round, although not throughout different game sessions as this is an arcade game after all.
- **Difficulty Scaling** As time goes on, the rounds get harder, different enemies appear and everything speeds up, forcing the player to be more precise as only so many keys can be pressed at once!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### How To Get ElevateOrAsphyxiate
- **Recommended**: Visit my itch.io page at "https://cimmerial.itch.io/elevate-or-asphyxiate" and download a build of the game
- Another way to do it: Clone the repository, install Unity, add the respository as a "New Project" then open and build it. 

### Gameplay Guide
- The keys on your keyboard map to their position on your screen ('Q' is the top left of the screen, 'G' is the center, and so on).
- All letter, number, and punctuation keys are fair game.
- When an alien shoots acid onto the window you look out, use the keys as windshield wipers to mop it up!
- Keys must be pressed, not tapped.
- Higher score = better performance
- If your oxygen bar drops to zero, you are out of luck.

### Developer Notes
- This is not a Game Design Document (GDD), and no GDD exists for this game as it was made for a fairly short game jam and felt unnecessary.
- The code can be found at Assets/Resources/Scripts
- Sadly, there is no controller support and will never be for ElevateOrAsphyxiate
